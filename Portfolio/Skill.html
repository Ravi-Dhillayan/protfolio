            <h2 class="ph2">HTML</h2>
             <p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the core language used to structure
                and display content on the web. As the backbone of web pages, HTML organizes 
                text, images, links, and other media into a readable format, enabling browsers
                to interpret and present information to users. From simple personal blogs to
                complex websites, HTML lays the foundation by defining the layout and content,
                making it essential for anyone looking to create or enhance a website.

             <p>
                CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a powerful language used to style and visually
                 enhance HTML content on the web. By controlling the look and layout of web
                elements, CSS allows developers to turn simple HTML structures into engaging and
                visually appealing web pages. It works by applying styles to elements using
                selectors, with properties that define everything from colors and fonts to 
                spacing and sizing. CSS also supports responsive design, making web content
                adaptable to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
                As the foundation for web design, CSS plays a crucial role in creating accessible, 
                user-friendly websites that align with modern aesthetics and functionality.

            <h2 class="ph2">C++</h2>
            <p> C++, or C Plus Plus, is a high-performance programming language that builds on the
                foundation of C while introducing advanced features like object-oriented programming,
                which promotes modular, organized, and reusable code. Known for its versatility, C++
                supports both low-level memory manipulation and high-level abstractions, making it a popular
                choice for a wide range of applications, from systems software and game development to 
                financial tools and complex simulations. With features like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism,
                C++ enables developers to create efficient, scalable, and maintainable code. It remains widely used today,
                valued for its speed, flexibility, and extensive libraries.</p>

            <h2 class="ph2">JAVA</h2>
             <p>Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity, portability, and
                robustness. Developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1990s, Java quickly gained popularity due to its
                "write once, run anywhere" philosophy, meaning Java applications can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
                Javaâ€™s object-oriented structure encourages organized, modular code through concepts like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism,
                which helps developers create scalable and maintainable software.</p>

            <h2 class="ph2">DSA</h2>
             <p>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a fundamental area in computer science that focuses on organizing data efficiently 
                and solving problems effectively. Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and 
                modified efficiently. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Each data 
                structure has its own strengths, making it suitable for different types of operations.
