                                                Student Management System project, coded in Java, provides a structured way to manage student records, making use of Java, MySQL, and JDBC for data storage and retrieval. Here’s a summary:

                            Functionality:

                            Secure Password Authentication: Ensures only authorized users can access the system.
                            Data Entry: Users can input new student records, including details like name, roll number, class, mobile number, email, address, and city.
                            CRUD Operations:
                            Insert: Stores student details in a MySQL database.
                            Search: Retrieves a student's information based on roll number.
                            Update: Allows modifications to specific details, like name, class, or mobile number.
                            Delete: Removes a student’s record using roll number.
                            Display: Lists all student records for easy viewing.
                            Interactive Menu: A main menu guides users through each operation with simple console prompts.
                            Technical Aspects:

                            Database Connection: Uses JDBC to connect with a MySQL database, ensuring data security and reliability.
                            Error Handling: Catches exceptions during database operations, maintaining system stability.
                            Dynamic Data Input: Uses Scanner for user inputs, supporting continuous data flow.
